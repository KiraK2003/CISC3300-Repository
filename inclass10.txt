1. The _DOM_______ represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page. 
2. To select a dom element by its id we can use _getElementID________. 
3. If you add HTML to a page using innerHTML (or several jQuery methods), you need to be aware of _XSS_______ otherwise, an attacker could gain access to your users' accounts. 4. HTML events are _things_______ that happen to HTML elements. 
5. _Event listeners_______ are a more recent approach to handling events. They can deal with more than one function at a time 
6. Create a webpage with a div element with the text “initial text”. When the div is clicked, replace the text with “added text!” and set a style attribute to set the background color to yellow. 
7. Include a screenshot of the output of the MAMP/XAMPP resource with the page showing “/test”.
